    #     CRITICAL | ERROR | WARNING | NOTICE | INFO | DEBUG

    # The overall default logging level can be specified in various ways,
    # listed below from strongest to weakest:
    #
    # 1. The --logging-level=<level> command line option overrides all other
    #    default specifications.
    #
    # 2. The environment variable CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL otherwise applies to
    #    all node commands if defined as a non-empty string.
    #
    # 3. The value of `level` that directly follows in this file.
    #
    # If no overall default level is provided via any of the above methods,
    # the node will default to INFO (the value of defaultLevel in
    # common/flogging/logging.go)

    # Default for all modules running within the scope of a node.
    # Note: this value is only used when --logging-level or CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL
    #       are not set
    #level:       info

    # The overall default values mentioned above can be overridden for the
    # specific components listed in the override section below.

    # Override levels for various node modules. These levels will be
    # applied once the node has completely started. They are applied at this
    # time in order to be sure every logger has been registered with the
